# Explainable Wind Power Forecast with Lale & Lime
This project cnosists a semi-automated data science pipeline and explainable workflow for wind power forecasts using Lale & Lime. 

This workflow enables data scientists to train, tweak and validate the pipeline with better explainability. In production, the semi-automated nature of the workflow allows data scientists to take real-time weather and power data to tune and re-train models on the fly.

The work is primarily done on Watson Studio. A requirements.txt for the dev environment on the Watson Studio notebook is provided if you'd like to replicate the results
